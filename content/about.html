          <li>
            I went to <strong class="font-medium">high school in Orange County, California</strong> and returned to <strong class="font-medium">Slovenia for university</strong>, where I completed a bachelor's degree in physics at the University of Ljubljana.
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="">
              I <strong class="font-medium">work professionally on</strong> signal processing and data analysis of biomechanical time series at <a href="https://www.tmg-bodyevolution.com/" class="link">TMG-BMC</a>, a biomechanics and kinesiology company that makes non-invasive sensors for quantifying muscle function in professional athletes and medical patients.

      <li>
        <p>The website is a static site built with the <a href="https://gohugo.io/" class="link">Hugo</a> static site generator.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Long-form tutorial articles are written in Markdown; 
          standalone pages, and components like the navigation menu and footer, are written in HTML for finer-grained control over design.
          A sprinkling of vanilla JavaScript is used to implement the mobile navigation bar and the dark/light theme switcher, although I've done my best to make this website functional without JavaScript.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        I use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="link">Tailwind CSS</a> for styling, and the font used on this site is <a href="https://github.com/rsms/inter" class="link">Inter</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/" class="link">Cloudflare Pages</a>.

      <li>
        The website's source code is <a href="https://github.com/ejmastnak/ejmastnak.com" class="link">available on GitHub</a>;
