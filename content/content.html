  <h1 class="text-3xl">What's on this website?</h1>

  <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-lg">
    Here is the technical writing, tutorial series, academic material, and miscellaneous side projects you can find on this site.

        <!-- Arch -->
        {{< contentitem src="/img/content-thumbnails/arch.png" alt="The Arch Linux logo." href="/tutorials/arch/about" title="Find your footing on Arch Linux" >}}
          Bite-sized steps toward a functional work environment after a minimal install of Arch.
          From the basics of network connections and hardware integration to power-user key bindings to eye-candy wallpapers.
