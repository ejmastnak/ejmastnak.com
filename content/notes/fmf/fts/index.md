## Course description

*Fizika trdne snovi* is a required course in solid state physics for third-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the summer semester of the 2020-21 academic year, when the course was taught by professor Janez Bonča (lecture) and asst. professor Tomaž Rejec (exercises). The course is based on Ashcroft and Mermin's *Solid State Physics*. Material covered in the course includes:

- crystal structure: the direct and reciprocal lattice
- scattering of x-rays by a crystal lattice
- the Sommerfeld theory of free electrons
- Bloch's theorem for electrons in a periodic potential
- the nearly-free electron model and the tight-binding model
- the semiclassical formalism for dynamics of Bloch electrons
- semiconductor physics: intrinsic semiconductors, doped semiconductors, and the p-n junction
- classical and quantum theories of lattice oscillations
- an introduction to anharmonic effects
