## Course description

*Matematika 3* is a required course for second-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the winter semester of the 2019-20 academic year, when the course was taught by asst. professor Oliver Dragičević (lecture); and asst. professor Martin Raič and dr. Blaž Jelenc (exercises). Material covered in the course includes:
