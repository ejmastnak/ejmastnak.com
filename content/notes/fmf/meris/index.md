## Course description

*Merjenje ionizirajočega sevanja* is an elective course for third-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program, with a focus on students considering a career in experimental particle physics. These notes are from the summer semester of the 2020-21 academic year, when the course was taught by professor Boštjan Golob (lecture) and dr. Luka Šantelj (exercises). Material covered in the course includes:

- the interaction of heavy charged particles with matter
- the interaction of photons with matter
- the fundamental working principles of gas-based, semiconducting, and scintillating particle detectors 
- methods for measuring and classifying particle mass
- an overview of neutron and photon detection
- an overview of radiation dosimetry
