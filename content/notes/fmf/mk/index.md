## Course description

*Continuum mechanics* is an elective course for third-year undergraduates in the FMF physics program. These notes are from the summer semester of the 2020-21 academic year, when the course was taught by professor Primož Ziherl (lecture) and assoc. professor Daniel Svenšek (exercises). The course covers elastomechanics and fluid mechanics at an upper-undergraduate level and is based on Landau and Lifschitz's *Theory of Elasticity* and *Fluid Mechanics*. Material covered in the course includes:

- the geometry of deformations and strain
- mechanical stress and elastic energy
- the mechanics of plates and rods
- elastic waves
- the dynamics of ideal fluids
- the dynamics of viscous fluids
- an introduction to the theory of the boundary layer and hydrodynamic instabilities
