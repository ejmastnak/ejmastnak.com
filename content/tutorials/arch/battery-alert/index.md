# Battery level alert 

{{< arch/header >}}
{{< date-last-mod >}}

**Goal:** Create a desktop notification when battery falls below a threshold percentage of your choice.

**Motivation:** Remind you to charge your battery, which will happily drain completely if given the chance.
And then your laptop's dead, and you have to find a charger, reboot and restart all your programs, and who wants to do that?

**Dependencies:** This guide works on the X Window System.
You should first [set up X]({{< relref "tutorials/arch/startx" >}}) if you have not yet done so.

**Reference:** [ArchWiki: Desktop notifications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications).

<!-- vim-markdown-toc -->

First install the [`libnotify` package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libnotify/), which is a package for sending desktop notifications.

### Set up a notification server

Using `libnotify` requires a *notification server*.
Most standard desktop environments (DEs) have a built-in notification server; if you don't use a DE (e.g. you use only a window manager) you'll probably need to set up a standalone notification server. 

#### Do you need a notification server?

After installing `libnotify`, try running `notify-send "Hello, world!"` from the command line.
If this produces a "Hello, world!" notification (probably in the top right of your screen inside a white rectangle with rounded corners), you're good to go---skip to the next section.
No notification appearing? 
Then you need a standalone notification server---here's what to do:

1. Install the [`notification-daemon` package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/notification-daemon/)
1. Create the `/usr/share/dbus-1/services/` directory (if necessary), inside it create the file `org.freedesktop.Notifications.service`, and inside the file add the following:

   ```systemd
   [D-BUS Service]
   Name=org.freedesktop.Notifications
   Exec=/usr/lib/notification-daemon-1.0/notification-daemon
   ```

After this (you may need to restart your X session) a shell command like `notify-send "Hello world!"` should produce a visible GUI desktop notification.
Reference: [ArchWiki: Desktop notifications: standalone](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications#Standalone).

### Check battery level programmatically

This is easiest using the built-in `acpi` command with the `-b` flag.
Here's an example `acpi` output for a discharging battery at 60% capacity:

```bash
$ acpi -b
Battery 0: Discharging, 60%, 03:54:00 remaining
```

{{< details summary="**Bonus:** View battery status through the `sysfs` file system" >}}
You can also interface with the battery using Linux’s [`sysfs` file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs), which lives in the `/sys` directory.
Battery information typically lives in the directory `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0` (you might also have a `BAT1` directory if your laptop has two batteries installed).
We’ll work with the following files within `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0`:

- The `capacity` file holds current battery capacity in percentage.
- The `status` file holds the battery’s charging status (e.g. `Charging`, `Discharging`).

You can check the battery and status programmatically by `cat`-ing the contents of a battery’s `sysfs` files:

```bash
# Example: a discharging battery at 60% capacity
$ cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity
60
$ cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status
Discharging
```

### Script with battery alert logic

I suggest using the script suggested in [ArchWiki: Laptop/Hibernate on low battery level](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Laptop#Hibernate_on_low_battery_level).
Place the script in any easily-accessible part of your file system; I use  `${HOME}/scripts/alert-battery.sh`.

The script uses `acpi` and `awk` to check if the battery is discharging and, if it is, if the battery capacity is less than the specified threshold.
If so, the script sends a desktop notification with `notify-send`.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# You could place this script in e.g. `${HOME}/scripts/alert-battery.sh`

threshold=15  # threshold percentage to trigger alert

# Use `awk` to capture `acpi`'s percent capacity ($2) and status ($3) fields
# and read their values into the `status` and `capacity` variables
acpi -b | awk -F'[,:%]' '{print $2, $3}' | {
  read -r status capacity

  # If battery is discharging with capacity below threshold
  if [ "${status}" = Discharging -a "${capacity}" -lt ${threshold} ];
  then
    # Send a notification that appears for 300000 ms (5 min)
    notify-send -t 300000 "Charge your battery!"
  fi
}
```

Remember to make the script executable (e.g. `chmod +x alert-battery.sh`).

Try playing with the `threshold` value and running the script manually (e.g. `sh alert-battery.sh`)---you should get a "Charge your battery!" notification as long as your current battery capacity is below threshold.
(You could set `threshold=101` to guarantee a notification.)

The last step is to create a `systemd` unit to run the above script automatically.

### Create a notification service and timer

Plan: create a `systemd` user service to run `alert-battery.sh`, and then create a `systemd` timer to periodically run the service.
(It might be helpful to browse through [ArchWiki: systemd/User](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd/User) if it's your first time writing `systemd` units.)

#### Create battery alert service

Create the file `~/.config/systemd/user/alert-battery.service` and inside it paste

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Desktop alert warning of low remaining battery

[Service]
Type=oneshot
# Change username and modify path to script as needed
ExecStart=/home/YOURUSERNAME/scripts/alert-battery.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical.target
```

This service unit runs the `alert-battery.sh` script; setting the unit's `Type` to `oneshot` ensures the battery alert service completes before any other `systemd` units run; `Type=oneshot` is standard practice for units that start short-running shell scripts.
The `~/.config/systemd/user` directory is the standard location for user units.

#### Create timer

Create the file `~/.config/systemd/user/alert-battery.timer` and inside it paste

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Check battery status every few minutes to warn the user in case of low battery
# Set `Requires` to the name of the battery alert service
Requires=alert-battery.service

# Define when and how the timer activates
[Timer]
# Start 1 minute after boot...
OnBootSec=1m
# ...and again every 5 minutes after `alert-battery.service` runs
OnUnitActiveSec=5m

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

The timer will run the `alert-battery.service` unit 1 minute after boot and then periodically every 5 minutes after `alert-battery.service` last activated.
See the `OPTIONS` section in `man 5 systemd.timer` for more on timer options.

{{< details summary="**Note:** Confusion around `OnUnitActiveSec`:" >}}
There is some confusion online about using `OnUnitActiveSec` to periodically run `Type=oneshot` services.
The theoretical problem is that `OnUnitActiveSec` runs relative to when the unit it triggers becomes active, but `Type=oneshot` units never become active---see e.g. [timer doesn’t fire #6680](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6680).
But the `OnUnitActiveSec` and `Type=oneshot` combination has worked well for me, and [`systemd` issue #21600](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21600) rightly points out that the `OnUnitActiveSec` and `Type=oneshot` combination is used in official `systemd` examples.
So I’m not sure if there is currently a problem or not.
If anyone reading this knows the best-practice way to run a `Type=oneshot` service once at boot and periodically thereafter, please let me know!

#### Reload and start timer

Use `daemon-reload` to tell `systemd` you've created new unit files, then start and enable the timer service:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now alert-battery.timer

# Optionally check that the timer is active
systemctl --user list-timers
```
Note that you only enable and start the `alert-battery.timer` unit and not the `.service` unit.
The battery alert system should be ready after this step.

Troubleshooting: If the timer fails to enable with a message along the lines of `Failed to enable unit: Unit file ~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/alert-battery.timer does not exist.`, just create the empty directory `~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/`.
Explanation: enabling units requires creating symlinks, and `systemctl` is complaining because the directory in which it would create a symlink does not exist yet.
Creating the directory solves the problem.
