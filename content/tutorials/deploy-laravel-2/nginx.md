This article shows how to configure Nginx for serving a Laravel web app.
We'll use [Laravel's example Nginx config](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#nginx)---it works well in my experience and I see no reason to reinvent the wheel here.
This article is basically a tour through Laravel's example Nginx config with short explanations of what each line does.

## Make an Nginx config

Create an Nginx config file for your Laravel app:

```bash
# Create an Nginx config for your Laravel app
laravel@server$ sudoedit /etc/nginx/sites-available/laravel
```

The site name `laravel` is arbitrary hereâ€”use whatever you like.

{{< details summary="More on Nginx config files" >}}
Two directories are relevant for Nginx configuration (at least on Debian and Ubuntu systems):

- `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` contains a dedicated config file for every website (or, more precisely, virtual host) hosted on your server, whether the site is currently enabled or not.
- `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` contains symlinks to files in the `sites-available/` folder.

The idea is to "activate" the site(s) you want Nginx to serve by creating a symlink in `sites-enabled/` linking to the site's config file in `sites/available/`.

**But there is a twist to the story...**

The `sites-available/` and `sites-enabled/` convention is specific to the version of Nginx packaged specifically for Debian and Ubuntu systems (supposedly the goal is to parallel the `a2ensite`/`a2dissite` workflow used with Apache).
Upstream versions of Nginx prefer using the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory for configuring your virtual hosts, and indeed `sites-enabled/` and `sites-available/` is said to be deprecated in [Chapter 1.5 of the Nginx cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/nginx-cookbook/9781492078470/ch01.html).

I'm sticking with `sites-enabled/` and `sites-available/` in this guide, since that's what you'll find in most online guides and what you'll probably have set up on your VPS out of the box.

See [this StackOverflow thread](https://serverfault.com/questions/527630/difference-in-sites-available-vs-sites-enabled-vs-conf-d-directories-nginx) for further reading.

Inside `/etc/nginx/sites-available/laravel` paste [Laravel's example Nginx config](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#nginx) (I've added some comments---feel free to remove them).

Make sure to:

- Update the `server_name` and `root` directives.
- Ensure the PHP version specified with `fastcgi_pass` matches your system PHP version.
- Ensure the path to the `phpX.X-fpm.sock` socket specified with `fastcgi_pass` is correct on your system.

The rest can be left as is.

```nginx
server {
  # Listen for connections on port 80 (HTTP)
  listen 80;
  # Add this if using IPv6 on your server
  # listen [::]:80;

  # IP addresses and domain names that should point to your app.
  # Set this to your server's IP address (and/or domain name, if you've set up DNS).
  server_name 1.2.3.4;
  # server_name 1.2.3.4 example.com;  # if using a domain name

  # The root directory for incoming web requests.
  # Set this to the full path to your Laravel app's `public` subdirectory,
  # which is the entry point to Laravel applications.
  root /srv/www/laravel/active/public;

  # This sets the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header such that your site can
  # be embedded in a frame only if the site including it is the same as the one
  # serving the page.
  # This supposedly serves to prevent click-jacking attacks; for details see
  # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options
  add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";

  # This sets the X-Content-Type-Options HTTP response header to help revent
  # MIME type sniffing. For details see
  # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

  # Use PHP (and not HTML) index files (because Laravel is PHP-based).
  index index.php;

  # Specify UTF-8 character encoding in Content-Type HTTP response header fields.
  charset utf-8;

  # The order recommended by Laravel for Nginx to check for the existence of
  # files based on a URI or query string.
  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
  }

  # Disable logging related to favicon and robots.txt files.
  location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
  location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

  # Redirect to the home page (i.e. /index.php) on 404 errors.
  error_page 404 /index.php;

  # Laravel's recommended for handling requests for PHP files.
  location ~ \.php$ {
    # The `fastcgi_pass` directive should point to the address of the FastCGI
    # Process Manager (FPM) on your server. The value below should be correct,
    # but you might need to tweak the PHP version (from e.g. 8.3 to 8.1)
    # depending on the PHP version installed on your server
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
  }

  # Denies all attempts to access hidden files that are not associated with
  # well-known services. See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI
  location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
    deny all;
  }
}
```

Note the path in the `root` directive is  `/srv/www/laravel/active/public;`.
We haven't created or mentioned the `active/` directory yet, but it will become immediately clear when we deploy your app; for now let's just say that `active/` will hold the active release of your Laravel app.

Here is the official documentation of [Nginx directives](http://nginx.org/en/docs/dirindex.html), if you're interested.

### Enable the Laravel site's Nginx config

Create a symlink to enable your Laravel site:

```bash
# Create a symlink enabling your Laravel app
laravel@server$ cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
laravel@server:sites-enabled$ sudo ln -s ../sites-available/laravel laravel

# Remove the active link to the default Nginx splash page
laravel@server:sites-enabled$ sudo rm default
```

Then test the syntax of the active Nginx config file:

```bash
# Test syntax of Nginx config file for errors/misconfiguration
laravel@server$ sudo nginx -t
```

Assuming the test succeeded, you can restart Nginx.

```bash
# Restart Nginx
laravel@server$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

The new `sites-enabled` link will take effect after restarting Nginx, and Nginx will begin serving your Laravel application (although you won't find anything there until we get to deploying your app).
